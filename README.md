Our complete solutions:
1.Financing :
•	keeping abreast of the state of the art
•	targeted investments
•	tailor-made financing
In order to always remain up-to-date in terms of technology, alternative and innovative financing options are increasingly important for many providers in the healthcare field. We offer tailor-made financing solutions for our customers and individually adapt these solutions to match your requirements.
2.Design :
•	demand-oriented planning
•	optimal workflow
•	focus on technical feasibility
Are you starting from scratch or based on existing building plans? We develop a technical planning including design proposals to meet your needs. To this end, we create visualisations of the project in advance and develop detailed constructional drawings for definitive implementation for you over the further course
3.Construction
•	keeping architectural aspects in mind
•	feasibility analysis
•	seamless integration of complex medical devices
We scrutinise your project idea, structure it and assess it for feasibility. We recommend you medical devices that exceed your individual requirements, and always make plans with a view to the architectural conditions. Whenever interior equipment needs to be changed, you can rely on our concepts. In particular in the case of existing projects, we have many years of experience in evaluating the architectural conditions from logistical and technical perspectives and taking account of the special requirements for complex medical devices
4.Resource planning :
•	analysis of requirements
•	optimising the patient flow
•	compliance with relevant standards
As far as your equipment is concerned, we do not accept compromises and rely exclusively on leading manufacturers and efficient products of the highest quality. On the basis of a careful analysis, we create a requirements planning for you and optimise the patient flow together with you. Next, we determine the relevant equipment and staffing needs, taking into account all applicable standards. 
5.Configuration :
•	configure individually
•	integrate into your workflow
•	meet specific requirements
When modernising an equipment pool or integrating new systems, it is always crucial that all individual components interoperate well. By means of appropriate configuration, we ensure that our systems integrate well into the workflows in your company and suit your requirements perfectly.
6.Installation :
•	proper installation
•	integration of special solutions
•	compliance with local regulations
Medical devices require proper installation and commissioning on site. Additional calibrations, safety checks or special solutions may be required. We consider it a matter of course that high-quality products are handed over with utmost diligence, too. We ensure this in cooperation with the manufacturers and with reliable partners of many years’ standing – taking into account the local regulations, of course. 
7.•	regular refreshment of knowledge :
User training is an important prerequisite for being able to use medical devices safely and over their full range of applications. As medical devices need to be controlled and serviced regularly, training of the technical staff is likewise important to ensure maintenance of the equipment in the long term. For these areas, we offer our customers retraining or refresher training courses at regular intervals. 
8.Warranty services:
•	long-term maintenance contracts
•	reliable partners
•	fast solutions
In order to allow systems to be scheduled safely and efficiently at any time, fast solutions are required when it comes to warranty handling. We will be pleased to agree extended warranty periods or conclude long-term maintenance contracts with your centre. Here we cooperate closely with our partners and manufacturers who have proven their reliability over many years.
9.After-Sales-Service :
•	perfectly organised facilities
•	efficient patient care
•	long-term partnership
We believe that good service does not end with the delivery of our systems, but the delivery is the beginning of a partnership with a shared goal: We want to build perfectly organised and functioning healthcare facilities together with our customers, in which patients are taken care of efficiently, safely and with state-of-the-art technology.
